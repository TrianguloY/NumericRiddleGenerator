This app is a tool to create your own riddles/escape rooms (those with relations number->text/image) to play at home with friends or anywhere else.

Note: you can specify only text, only image or both for each 4-digit number

This is the list of things you can customize:
- Title of the app
- Text of a specific number
- Image of a specific number
- Text of not-specified number

This is the list of things you can't customize (yet)
- Theme of the app
- Background
- Number of digits (only 4)
- Image of not-specified number

As of update 2.0 there is now a demo you can load to see how it works.
Many thanks to Jorge del Castillo for it!


If you have any suggestion feel free to contact me (or write it in the comments) although I can't promise I'll be able to implement it :/
